The two-step process is explicitly articulated, leaving no ambiguity about the sequence or purpose of each tool call. While the question doesn't literally name the tools, the functional description is so direct that tool selection becomes trivial. Alternative tools such as add_new_knowledge_document_source or update_knowledge_document_source are clearly irrelevant to the retrieval-focused task, and load_image is not mentioned or implied.

The list_knowledge_document_sources tool is the only available method to discover existing knowledge sources\u2014no other tool provides inventory functionality. Subsequently, query_knowledge_base is exclusively capable of searching those sources; no alternative tool offers retrieval capabilities. The sequential dependency is mandatory: one cannot query specific relevant sources without first identifying them. The question's requirement to search \"across only those identified sources\" (implying filtered selection based on relevance and currency) makes the two-step sequence not just optimal but essential. Attempting to bypass the first step by querying all sources would violate the user's explicit requirement to target only current, relevant repositories.

Among the available tools, \"create_component\" is the most direct match for modeling the custom enclosure, and \"export_scene\" clearly corresponds to generating the scaled drawing. While the question doesn't explicitly name these tools, the mapping is fairly intuitive for anyone familiar with 3D modeling workflows. However, the mention of positioning requirements (\"maintain a 1-meter safety clearance from the existing conveyor line\") introduces ambiguity about whether \"transform_component\" is also needed to properly place the component in the scene. This positioning requirement adds a layer of reasoning complexity, as users must decide whether to include placement functionality. The task doesn't require specialized domain knowledge beyond understanding basic 3D modeling concepts, and alternative approaches (like using \"eval_ruby\" to script the entire process) would be overly complex and impractical. Therefore, tool selection requires some analysis but remains within reasonable expectations for a technical user.", "score": 3}, "tool_selection_uniqueness": {"reasoning": "The tool combination of \"create_component\" followed by \"export_scene\" is particularly well-matched to this specific task. The workflow has a natural sequential dependency: you must first create the junction box component before you can export the scene containing it. This sequence is non-negotiable for generating the required deliverable. While \"eval_ruby\" could theoretically be used to achieve similar results through custom scripting, this would be significantly more complex and less direct, making it an impractical alternative. The specialized joint creation tools (mortise_tenon, dovetail, finger_joint) are completely irrelevant to fabricating a simple electrical enclosure. The material setting tool could optionally be used but isn't essential to the core request. No other tool combination would accomplish both the modeling and drawing generation as efficiently and appropriately as create_component + export_scene. This pairing directly addresses the user's dual objectives of creating a model and producing a permit-ready drawing.", "score": 4}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates exceptional quality across multiple dimensions. It provides precise technical specifications (600mm x 400mm x 250mm) essential for accurate modeling. The context is richly detailed, specifying the location (manufacturing plant Bay 3), equipment type (VFD junction box for conveyor motors), and clear functional requirements (1-meter safety clearance, maintenance accessibility). The purpose is explicitly stated (electrical permit approval and contractor coordination), giving clear motivation and defining the deliverable quality needed. The language is professional, concise, and action-oriented without ambiguity. The question balances sufficient technical detail with clarity, avoiding both overwhelming minutiae and vague requirements. It naturally establishes the priority constraints (safety, accessibility, regulatory compliance) that would guide modeling decisions. This represents a well-formed, enterprise-grade request that mirrors real-world engineering communication.", "score": 5}, "scenario_realism": {"reasoning": "This scenario reflects an authentic industrial electrical engineering workflow that occurs regularly in manufacturing facilities. Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) installations are common upgrades for conveyor systems. The requirement for custom junction box sizing indicates real-world constraints where off-the-shelf enclosures don't meet specifications. The 1-meter safety clearance requirement aligns with electrical code standards (like NEC, IEC) for working space around electrical equipment. The need for scaled drawings for permit approval is a universal requirement across jurisdictions. The multi-stakeholder aspect (permits, contractors, maintenance teams) accurately represents real project coordination needs. The mention of specific plant location (Bay 3) adds organizational authenticity. The entire scenario\u2014from equipment upgrade planning through regulatory compliance to contractor handoff\u2014mirrors the exact process industrial maintenance and engineering teams follow, making this indistinguishable from an actual professional request.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The correctness of the answer can be verified through multiple objective criteria. First, the created component must have exact dimensions of 600mm x 400mm x 250mm, which is easily measurable in the Sketchup model. Second, the export_scene tool must successfully generate a drawing file, verifiable by file existence and format. Third, the 1-meter safety clearance can be dimensionally verified in the exported drawing by measuring the distance between the junction box and conveyor line components. Fourth, the maintenance accessibility requirement, while slightly more subjective, can be evaluated by verifying clear access paths and compliant working space volumes in the model. The permit approval context implies the drawing must meet professional standards (proper scaling, clear dimensions, appropriate views), which are verifiable against engineering documentation standards. While optimal placement might have minor subjective elements, the core deliverables (correctly sized model and scaled drawing) provide clear, measurable verification points.", "score": 4}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The question asks for creation of a static, dimensionally-specified object and its drawing output. This task is completely independent of temporal factors\u2014the junction box dimensions and safety requirements don't change over time. It's geographically invariant, as electrical codes for working space are consistent globally in principle (even if specific distances vary, the 1-meter requirement is given explicitly). The task is unaffected by operating system differences, network environments, or software versions beyond basic Sketchup compatibility. The available tools perform deterministic operations: create_component will always produce the same geometry given the same parameters, and export_scene will always generate equivalent drawing output. There are no real-time data dependencies, dynamic variables, or conditional logic that would cause answer variation.

This component must be positioned in the 3D model to maintain a 1-meter clearance from the existing conveyor system in Bay 3 while ensuring maintenance accessibility. Second, after verifying the placement and spatial relationships within the facility model, the drafter uses export_scene to generate a scaled master sketch that shows the exact specifications and dimensions of the proposed installation relative to existing facilities. This exported scene serves as the official submission document for permit applications and contractor bidding."}

While the user clearly specifies the need for \"Manufacturing Fundamentals\" course structure and IEP student performance data on hands-on projects, the question is ambiguous about which platform hosts which data type. An expert must infer that: (1) course structure (modules, assignments) typically resides in Canvas, while (2) detailed performance data for hands-on projects is likely in Gradescope if that's the submission/grading platform. The question doesn't explicitly mention either platform, requiring domain knowledge about educational technology workflows. Alternative valid approaches exist, such as using search_education_platforms for a unified search, or using Canvas-specific tools for structure and Gradescope for performance data. This ambiguity places it squarely in the \"medium\" difficulty range\u2014not trivial enough to be \"easy\" (since platform determination requires inference), but not \"hard\" enough to require extensive expertise or deep system analysis.", "score": 3}, "tool_selection_uniqueness": {"reasoning": "The intended Gradescope-only approach (get_gradescope_course_by_name + call_search_gradescope) is moderately unique. While these tools can effectively locate course information and search for performance data, several viable alternatives exist that are equally appropriate. Users could: (1) employ search_education_platforms for a unified Canvas+Gradescope search, (2) use Canvas tools (get_courses, get_modules) for structure combined with Gradescope tools for performance data, or (3) use find_resources for targeted content discovery. The selected tools are well-suited for the task but not uniquely required\u2014the task can be accomplished through multiple tool combinations without significant disadvantage. The sequence lacks strong sequential dependencies that would make it the only viable path.", "score": 3}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates strong professional quality with clear context, specific objectives, and actionable requirements. It effectively communicates the user's intent: preparing for a special education meeting, reviewing a specific course (\"Manufacturing Fundamentals\"), and retrieving targeted performance data (IEP students, hands-on projects, last semester). The language is natural and workflow-oriented. However, it falls short of \"excellent\" due to technical ambiguity: it doesn't specify which platform contains the course structure versus performance data, and leaves \"performance data\" undefined (grades, completion rates, submission details?). While the scenario and intent are crystal clear, the implementation details require inference, preventing it from reaching the highest rating tier.", "score": 4}, "scenario_realism": {"reasoning": "This scenario represents an exceptionally authentic educational workflow. Teachers regularly meet with special education coordinators to discuss IEP accommodations for upcoming assessments. The practice of reviewing historical performance data to inform modifications is standard professional procedure. Manufacturing fundamentals as a CTE course with hands-on projects is a common real-world offering. The combination of legal requirements (IEP compliance), professional collaboration (coordinator meeting), and data-driven decision-making mirrors actual educator responsibilities. The timeline (preparing for tomorrow's meeting) and the specific data requests (course structure + IEP student performance) reflect genuine practitioner needs, making this indistinguishable from real-world educational scenarios.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The answer's correctness can be moderately verified through systematic checks. A reviewer can validate that: (1) the correct \"Manufacturing Fundamentals\" course was retrieved by cross-referencing the actual course catalog, (2) IEP student performance data was successfully extracted from the identified platform, and (3) the retrieved data matches the source system's records. However, verification requires human judgment because the answer will likely be a narrative summary or tabular data rather than a deterministic output. The subjective nature of what constitutes relevant \"performance data\" and the need to log into Canvas/Gradescope to confirm accuracy prevents this from being \"easy to verify,\" but the data-driven nature makes it more verifiable than purely subjective free-form responses.", "score": 3}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The answer is highly unstable across temporal and user-specific dimensions. The phrase \"last semester\" creates temporal dependency\u2014the answer changes completely depending on when the question is asked (Fall vs. Spring semester contexts). Course offerings and enrollments vary by academic term, affecting whether \"Manufacturing Fundamentals\" exists. The user-specific nature of course access means different instructors would receive different answers. IEP student populations fluctuate semester-to-semester, potentially yielding empty result sets. Platform configurations and data retention policies may vary by institution.

For the 3D modeling portion, the user requests a \"dovetail\" joint without mentioning Sketchup specifically\u2014while `create_dovetail` is semantically obvious, it requires recognizing this tool among 10 available Sketchup tools and understanding its specific capability for parametric joint creation. The machining parameters request is substantially more challenging: the assistant must recognize that Sketchup Integration tools cannot provide feeds/speeds calculations, logically deduce the need to leverage Toolbox's discovery capabilities, and formulate a strategy to search for and execute tools from an unspecified machining calculator MCP. This requires cross-domain reasoning (CAD vs. manufacturing), understanding tool server limitations, and planning a sequential workflow (potentially search_servers \u2192 use_tool). The absence of explicit tool names, combined with the need to chain operations across different servers for distinct technical domains, elevates this beyond straightforward selection. While the dovetail geometry mapping is direct, the machining parameter retrieval demands inference, domain knowledge, and multi-step tool orchestration that is not immediately obvious from the query structure.", "score": 4}, "tool_selection_uniqueness": {"reasoning": "The solution exhibits moderate uniqueness with a clear division of labor between servers. The `create_dovetail` tool is highly specialized\u2014while one could theoretically construct a dovetail using `create_component` and `eval_ruby`, this would require extensive manual geometry calculation and Ruby scripting, making the dedicated joint creation tool the uniquely optimal choice. For machining parameters, the path through Toolbox is necessary but not entirely unique; multiple MCP servers (e.g., Machining Calculator, Manufacturing Data Hub, Tooling Advisor) could potentially provide feeds and speeds. The specific sequence (Sketchup for geometry \u2192 Toolbox for machining data) is logical but alternative workflows could exist, such as using a comprehensive CAM integration MCP that handles both geometry and manufacturing parameters. The question forces the two-server approach because no single available tool covers both requirements, making the overall solution moderately unique rather than singularly deterministic.", "score": 3}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates exceptional quality across all dimensions. It provides comprehensive technical specifications including precise dimensions (30mm wide, 10mm deep, 55\u00b0 angle), material properties (1018 steel with \u00b10.02mm tolerance), machining constraints (20mm carbide dovetail cutter, vertical CNC mill), and optimization criteria (surface finish priority). The language is professional, using industry-standard terminology (feeds/speeds, depth of cut, QC department, inspection fixture, gauge block holder). The narrative structure establishes clear context, purpose, and workflow sequence: design verification before manufacturing. Information architecture is logical, separating geometric requirements from machining parameters while maintaining connection through the dovetail specification. The question is immediately actionable, containing all necessary inputs for both tool invocations without ambiguity.

The context\u2014machining an inspection fixture for a QC department\u2014represents a common manufacturing requirement.

Technical details are industry-accurate: 1018 steel is a widely used low-carbon steel for fixtures, \u00b10.02mm tolerance is appropriate for inspection-grade components, and dovetail joints are standard for precision alignment. The specification of a 20mm carbide dovetail cutter on a vertical CNC mill matches typical machining setups. The shop standard of optimizing for surface finish demonstrates realistic manufacturing constraint awareness. The two-phase request (CAD verification + machining parameters) aligns with how engineers actually work, making this indistinguishable from a genuine technical support query in a manufacturing environment.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The answer contains verifiable objective components with minor subjective elements. The 3D modeling output can be validated by inspecting generated geometry for exact dimensional compliance (30mm width, 10mm depth, 55\u00b0 angle) and component relationships. The machining parameters (feed rate, spindle speed, depth of cut) are calculable numerical values derived from machinist's handbook formulas and manufacturer data, making them objectively verifiable against standards like those from Harvey Tool, Kennametal, or Sandvik. The \"surface finish optimization\" criterion introduces some subjectivity in parameter selection (e.g., choosing between slightly higher feed with lower speed vs. lower feed with higher speed), but the resulting parameter ranges remain bounded by established engineering principles. The answer format would likely present discrete numerical values and geometric confirmation, enabling automated or manual verification through comparison with manufacturing databases and CAD inspection tools, though slight variations between different tooling manufacturers' recommendations prevent absolute deterministic verification.", "score": 4}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The answer exhibits moderate stability across environmental variations. The geometric model is highly stable\u2014dimensional parameters (30mm, 10mm, 55\u00b0) and material designation (1018 steel) are permanent physical constants unaffected by time or location. However, machining parameters demonstrate moderate instability: recommended feeds/speeds evolve with tooling technology updates, manufacturer data revisions, and new cutting tool coatings; different MCP servers may source data from varying references (e.g., MachiningCloud vs. Iscar vs. proprietary shop data); and registry availability of specific machining calculator MCPs could change. Geographic factors have minimal impact as metric standards and 1018 steel (AISI/SAE) are globally recognized, though equivalent steel grades (e.g., C18 in Europe) might cause slight parameter adjustments. System-level variations in Toolbox server discovery could yield different MCP candidates, potentially altering parameter recommendations.

First, it conflates two distinct tasks: \"building a reusable system\" and \"automatically generating compelling descriptions.\" This ambiguity requires the user to determine whether the primary need is infrastructure (building an MCP server) or content generation (using existing generation tools). Second, among the Prompt Server tools, multiple alternatives could address parts of the task: `gen_podcast_script` could generate announcements, `mimeng_headline_master` could create promotional headlines, and `prompt_template_generator` could build reusable templates. Third, the connection to Adwords MCP's `gc` tool is non-obvious\u2014the tool's name doesn't clearly indicate its function, and its relevance to amusement park promotions requires inferential leaps about promotional content generation.

While `build_mcp_server` aligns with the \"build a reusable system\" requirement, the user could achieve similar outcomes through alternative workflows: using `prompt_template_generator` to create reusable announcement templates, then invoking `gen_podcast_script` or `mimeng_headline_master` for generation. The `gc` tool from Adwords MCP appears particularly non-unique\u2014its function is undefined in the description, and multiple other tools (`gen_podcast_script`, `mimeng_headline_master`) could generate promotional content. The sequential dependency (building a server then using gc) feels artificially constructed rather than naturally necessary.

The structured format with numbered requirements enhances readability. However, it suffers from slight ambiguity in technical scope\u2014whether the user should build a new MCP server infrastructure or simply create a reusable prompt template.

Industry practices align perfectly: amusement parks routinely make PA announcements to promote attractions and drive guest traffic to revenue centers like restaurants and arcades. The stakeholder role is credible\u2014a senior attendant would plausibly be responsible for guest communications and could reasonably seek to automate repetitive announcement creation. The business logic is sound: cross-promoting attractions to maximize per-guest spending is standard park operations. The technical approach (using AI to generate engaging promotional copy) reflects modern marketing practices. The only minor stretch is that an attendant would personally build an MCP server rather than working with IT, but this is plausible in a tech-forward organization or small park where staff wear multiple hats.

The \"reusable\" requirement can be confirmed by examining parameterization (e.g., templates accepting variables for attraction names).

The connection to scientificmethod is explicit in the question's wording. While the exact Sci-Hub sub-tool requires minor consideration (search_scihub_by_keyword would be needed first to identify papers, followed by get_paper_metadata for compilation), the question's mention of \"bibliography\" makes get_paper_metadata a logical primary choice. The domain knowledge required is minimal\u2014only basic understanding that Sci-Hub handles academic papers and scientificmethod applies formal reasoning.

For the bibliography component, get_paper_metadata is the only tool specifically designed for retrieving paper metadata essential for citation. While search_scihub_by_keyword would be needed first to identify relevant papers, get_paper_metadata remains the appropriate tool for the \"compilation\" step. The sequence is logical: retrieve paper metadata, then apply scientificmethod to structure the answer based on that literature.

The structured answer's use of scientific reasoning can be verified by checking for key elements: hypothesis framing, evidence presentation, and uncertainty quantification. The confidence distinctions can be validated against established scientific consensus sources like IPCC AR6 reports. While the accessibility of language and specific phrasing involve subjective judgment, the core factual claims and paper selections are grounded in verifiable sources.

Geographical and OS variations have minimal impact since MCP servers are platform-independent.

Additionally, while the 2019-2024 paper set is fixed, judgments about \"most relevant\" could vary slightly between researchers, introducing minor variability.

First, the user needs to create \"custom 3D geometry\" for an \"acanthus leaf pattern\" - this is complex ornamental geometry that cannot be created with basic component tools. The pattern must repeat every 12 inches along a 20-foot span, requiring parametric, programmatic generation. Among the available tools, only `eval_ruby` has the capability to execute arbitrary code for generating such complex, repeating geometry. This requires the user to: (1) recognize the complexity of acanthus leaf modeling, (2) understand SketchUp's limitations with standard tools, (3) connect the need for parametric modeling to Ruby scripting, and (4) additionally identify `set_material` for the lime plaster application. While an experienced SketchUp user would find this logical, it's not explicitly stated and requires domain knowledge about when scripting is necessary versus manual modeling. The ambiguity level is moderate-to-high, and alternative solutions like using `create_component` would be insufficient for the custom geometry requirement. Therefore, tool selection demands careful reasoning but not extensive expertise beyond standard SketchUp workflow knowledge.", "score": 4}, "tool_selection_uniqueness": {"reasoning": "The intended combination of `eval_ruby` and `set_material` is highly specialized for this task. For the geometry creation, `eval_ruby` is essentially the only viable tool - the alternative would be manually creating each acanthus leaf (which defeats the purpose of AI assistance and the \"custom 3D geometry\" request). The joint-creation tools (`create_mortise_tenon`, `create_dovetail`, `create_finger_joint`) are completely irrelevant to crown molding. Basic tools like `create_component` cannot generate complex parametric geometry. The sequence is also uniquely necessary: geometry must be created before material can be applied, making the `eval_ruby` \u2192 `set_material` workflow non-negotiable. The task specifically requires both procedural generation and material assignment in that order, with no viable alternative tool combinations available in the provided set.", "score": 5}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates exceptional quality across all metrics. It provides precise specifications (6-inch height, 12-inch repeat, 20-foot length) and contextual details (historic building restoration, lime plaster material, client presentation, and material quantity calculation). The language is professional and actionable, clearly articulating a two-phase workflow: geometry creation followed by material application. The scenario is well-motivated and includes realistic stakeholder needs. The only minor improvement could be specifying the exact acanthus leaf profile, but this is appropriately left as a design interpretation for the AI. The question effectively balances technical specificity with workflow clarity, making it an excellent example of a professional tool-use query.", "score": 5}, "scenario_realism": {"reasoning": "This scenario is exceptionally authentic and reflects genuine professional practice in heritage conservation. Historic building restoration frequently requires recreating missing ornamental elements. SketchUp is a standard tool for architectural visualization and historical preservation documentation. The specifications are realistic: 6-inch crown molding height is standard, 12-inch pattern repeat is typical for classical ornamentation, and 20-foot wall sections are common in historic structures. Using lime plaster is historically accurate for period-appropriate restoration. The workflow of creating geometry for client review and material quantity takeoffs mirrors actual architectural practice. Every element - from the stakeholder involvement to the material specification - demonstrates industry-accurate knowledge.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The answer can be verified through multiple objective criteria despite containing some subjective design elements. The Ruby code can be validated for: correct component dimensions (6\" height \u00d7 20' length), proper pattern repetition logic (12-inch spacing, ~20 instances), and successful component creation in the model space. The material application can be verified by checking that the `set_material` tool was called and that the component has the lime plaster material assigned. While the artistic interpretation of \"acanthus leaf pattern\" involves subjective aesthetics, the functional parameters are entirely measurable. A verification script could confirm dimensional accuracy, pattern repetition count, material assignment, and component naming, providing clear success metrics beyond visual judgment.", "score": 4}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The answer demonstrates complete independence from temporal, geographical, and system variables. The task involves classical architectural elements (acanthus leaf motif) that are timeless and not subject to trends. The dimensional specifications (inches/feet) are unit-system agnostic within SketchUp's environment. SketchUp's Ruby API maintains strong backward compatibility across versions, ensuring code stability. There are no real-time data requirements, location-specific material definitions, or network dependencies.

No other tool combination can produce the required visual signal flow diagram. The pairing is perfectly matched to the dual output requirement (analysis + documentation), making alternative approaches substantially less efficient or effective.", "score": 5}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates exceptional quality across all dimensions. It provides rich contextual background (live sound installation repair, intermittent signal loss), specifies technical scope (FPGA, DSP, ADC/DAC stages) and origin points (XLR inputs), and articulates a clear dual-purpose objective (troubleshooting + service manual documentation). The language is professional and technically precise, using industry-standard terminology. Actionability is high: requirements are unambiguous, expected deliverables are specified (visual flow diagram of complete signal chain), and the complexity level matches the tool capabilities. No critical information ismissing, and the narrative flows logically from problem description to technical requirements to business justification. This reflects a genuine professional workflow.", "score": 5}, "scenario_realism": {"reasoning": "This scenario is indistinguishable from real-world electronics repair and documentation workflows. Digital audio mixers with FPGA/DSP architectures are standard in professional live sound applications. Intermittent signal loss is a common failure mode requiring systematic signal path tracing. Using KiCad schematics for reverse-engineering and troubleshooting is standard practice in electronics repair shops and OEM service departments. The dual motivation\u2014immediate troubleshooting plus updating service documentation\u2014mirrors professional technician priorities and asset management practices. The component types (XLR inputs, multiple ADC/DAC stages) and signal chain complexity accurately represent high-end audio equipment design. No aspect feels contrived; this is precisely how field service engineers and repair technicians operate.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The answer comprises two verifiable components: (1) a structured connection analysis from the KiCad schematic, and (2) a visual flow diagram. The connection analysis can be objectively validated by cross-referencing the actual schematic files\u2014net names, component references, and pin connections are factual data. The signal path tracing can be verified by systematically checking each identified stage against the source schematic. The visual diagram's content (nodes representing components, edges representing signal flow) is grounded in objective schematic data, though minor layout variations are acceptable. This is more verifiable than free-form text but less deterministic than a single-value answer. Verification requires technical review against source files, but clear success criteria exist: correct component sequence, accurate net identification, and complete path coverage.", "score": 4}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The answer exhibits maximum stability. KiCad project files are static, local assets\u2014no temporal dependencies, network conditions, or real-time data affect the schematic content. Geolocation and operating system differences do not alter circuit connectivity. The only potential variation source is the `visualReasoning` tool's diagram layout algorithms, which may produce visually different but semantically identical graphs. However, the core signal path mapping (component sequence, net names, connection points) is entirely deterministic based on the schematic files. Tool versions could theoretically affect parsing, but this is a system dependency, not environmental volatility.

The output from this analysis\u2014the structured connection data and netlist information\u2014is then fed to `visualReasoning`, which creates a comprehensive visual flowchart diagramming the signal chain. The visual reasoning tool organizes the components into a logical left-to-right flow, annotates critical test points, and highlights potential failure locations, producing a diagram suitable for field troubleshooting and service manual inclusion."}
