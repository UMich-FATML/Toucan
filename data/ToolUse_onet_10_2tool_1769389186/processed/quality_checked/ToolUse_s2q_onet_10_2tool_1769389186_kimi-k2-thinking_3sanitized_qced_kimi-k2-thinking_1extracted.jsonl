While the question doesn't explicitly name these tools, the mapping is fairly intuitive for anyone familiar with 3D modeling workflows. However, the mention of positioning requirements (\"maintain a 1-meter safety clearance from the existing conveyor line\") introduces ambiguity about whether \"transform_component\" is also needed to properly place the component in the scene. This positioning requirement adds a layer of reasoning complexity, as users must decide whether to include placement functionality.

Fourth, the maintenance accessibility requirement, while slightly more subjective, can be evaluated by verifying clear access paths and compliant working space volumes in the model.

Could you help me locate my course details and find that student performance information?"}], "quality_assessment_kimi-k2-thinking": {"tool_selection_difficulty": {"reasoning": "The question requires moderate reasoning to determine appropriate tools. While the user clearly specifies the need for \"Manufacturing Fundamentals\" course structure and IEP student performance data on hands-on projects, the question is ambiguous about which platform hosts which data type. An expert must infer that: (1) course structure (modules, assignments) typically resides in Canvas, while (2) detailed performance data for hands-on projects is likely in Gradescope if that's the submission/grading platform. The question doesn't explicitly mention either platform, requiring domain knowledge about educational technology workflows. Alternative valid approaches exist, such as using search_education_platforms for a unified search, or using Canvas-specific tools for structure and Gradescope for performance data. This ambiguity places it squarely in the \"medium\" difficulty range—not trivial enough to be \"easy\" (since platform determination requires inference), but not \"hard\" enough to require extensive expertise or deep system analysis.", "score": 3}, "tool_selection_uniqueness": {"reasoning": "The intended Gradescope-only approach (get_gradescope_course_by_name + call_search_gradescope) is moderately unique. While these tools can effectively locate course information and search for performance data, several viable alternatives exist that are equally appropriate. Users could: (1) employ search_education_platforms for a unified Canvas+Gradescope search, (2) use Canvas tools (get_courses, get_modules) for structure combined with Gradescope tools for performance data, or (3) use find_resources for targeted content discovery. The selected tools are well-suited for the task but not uniquely required—the task can be accomplished through multiple tool combinations without significant disadvantage. The sequence lacks strong sequential dependencies that would make it the only viable path.", "score": 3}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates strong professional quality with clear context, specific objectives, and actionable requirements. It effectively communicates the user's intent: preparing for a special education meeting, reviewing a specific course (\"Manufacturing Fundamentals\"), and retrieving targeted performance data (IEP students, hands-on projects, last semester). The language is natural and workflow-oriented. However, it falls short of \"excellent\" due to technical ambiguity: it doesn't specify which platform contains the course structure versus performance data, and leaves \"performance data\" undefined (grades, completion rates, submission details?). While the scenario and intent are crystal clear, the implementation details require inference, preventing it from reaching the highest rating tier.", "score": 4}, "scenario_realism": {"reasoning": "This scenario represents an exceptionally authentic educational workflow. Teachers regularly meet with special education coordinators to discuss IEP accommodations for upcoming assessments. The practice of reviewing historical performance data to inform modifications is standard professional procedure. Manufacturing fundamentals as a CTE course with hands-on projects is a common real-world offering. The combination of legal requirements (IEP compliance), professional collaboration (coordinator meeting), and data-driven decision-making mirrors actual educator responsibilities. The timeline (preparing for tomorrow's meeting) and the specific data requests (course structure + IEP student performance) reflect genuine practitioner needs, making this indistinguishable from real-world educational scenarios.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The answer's correctness can be moderately verified through systematic checks. A reviewer can validate that: (1) the correct \"Manufacturing Fundamentals\" course was retrieved by cross-referencing the actual course catalog, (2) IEP student performance data was successfully extracted from the identified platform, and (3) the retrieved data matches the source system's records. However, verification requires human judgment because the answer will likely be a narrative summary or tabular data rather than a deterministic output. The subjective nature of what constitutes relevant \"performance data\" and the need to log into Canvas/Gradescope to confirm accuracy prevents this from being \"easy to verify,\" but the data-driven nature makes it more verifiable than purely subjective free-form responses.", "score": 3}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The answer is highly unstable across temporal and user-specific dimensions. The phrase \"last semester\" creates temporal dependency—the answer changes completely depending on when the question is asked (Fall vs. Spring semester contexts). Course offerings and enrollments vary by academic term, affecting whether \"Manufacturing Fundamentals\" exists. The user-specific nature of course access means different instructors would receive different answers. IEP student populations fluctuate semester-to-semester, potentially yielding empty result sets. Platform configurations and data retention policies may vary by institution. These factors combine to produce dramatically different answers based on timing, user identity, and institutional context, making the response highly unstable.", "score": 1}, "overall_score": 3.1666666666666665}, "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000002", "row_id": 2, "mode": "onet_occupation", "question_gen_args": {"num_tools": 2, "total_prompts": 10, "output_folder": "../data", "job_name": null, "timestamp": 1769389186, "seed": null}, "onet_soc_code": "25-2023.00", "occupation_title": "Career/Technical Education Teachers, Middle School", "sampled_tools": [{"server_idx": 733, "tool_idx": 9, "tool_name": "get_gradescope_course_by_name", "server_name": "Canvas MCP"}, {"server_idx": 811, "tool_idx": 14, "tool_name": "call_search_gradescope", "server_name": "Canvas Integration Server"}], "mcp_servers": [{"server_id": 1019, "server_name": "Canvas MCP", "rank_by_usage": 1020, "server_info": {"id": 1019, "name": "Canvas MCP", "author": "@aryankeluskar/canvas-mcp", "overview": "EdTech MCP.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm setting up a job to machine an inspection fixture for our QC department. The fixture has a dovetail joint that needs to be 30mm wide, 10mm deep, with a 55-degree included angle, and must hold a tolerance of ±0.02mm in 1018 steel. Before I commit to cutting, I need to model this dovetail in 3D to make sure it'll mate properly with our gauge block holder. After that checks out, I need to figure out the right feeds, speeds, and depth of cut for machining this on our vertical CNC mill using a 20mm carbide dovetail cutter. Our shop standard is to optimize for surface finish since it's a precision fixture. Can you help me with the 3D modeling and get me the machining parameters?"}], "quality_assessment_kimi-k2-thinking": {"tool_selection_difficulty": {"reasoning": "The question presents a dual-domain challenge requiring significant reasoning to identify appropriate tools. For the 3D modeling portion, the user requests a \"dovetail\" joint without mentioning Sketchup specifically—while `create_dovetail` is semantically obvious, it requires recognizing this tool among 10 available Sketchup tools and understanding its specific capability for parametric joint creation. The machining parameters request is substantially more challenging: the assistant must recognize that Sketchup Integration tools cannot provide feeds/speeds calculations, logically deduce the need to leverage Toolbox's discovery capabilities, and formulate a strategy to search for and execute tools from an unspecified machining calculator MCP. This requires cross-domain reasoning (CAD vs. manufacturing), understanding tool server limitations, and planning a sequential workflow (potentially search_servers → use_tool). The absence of explicit tool names, combined with the need to chain operations across different servers for distinct technical domains, elevates this beyond straightforward selection. While the dovetail geometry mapping is direct, the machining parameter retrieval demands inference, domain knowledge, and multi-step tool orchestration that is not immediately obvious from the query structure.", "score": 4}, "tool_selection_uniqueness": {"reasoning": "The solution exhibits moderate uniqueness with a clear division of labor between servers. The `create_dovetail` tool is highly specialized—while one could theoretically construct a dovetail using `create_component` and `eval_ruby`, this would require extensive manual geometry calculation and Ruby scripting, making the dedicated joint creation tool the uniquely optimal choice. For machining parameters, the path through Toolbox is necessary but not entirely unique; multiple MCP servers (e.g., Machining Calculator, Manufacturing Data Hub, Tooling Advisor) could potentially provide feeds and speeds. The specific sequence (Sketchup for geometry → Toolbox for machining data) is logical but alternative workflows could exist, such as using a comprehensive CAM integration MCP that handles both geometry and manufacturing parameters. The question forces the two-server approach because no single available tool covers both requirements, making the overall solution moderately unique rather than singularly deterministic.", "score": 3}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates exceptional quality across all dimensions. It provides comprehensive technical specifications including precise dimensions (30mm wide, 10mm deep, 55° angle), material properties (1018 steel with ±0.02mm tolerance), machining constraints (20mm carbide dovetail cutter, vertical CNC mill), and optimization criteria (surface finish priority). The language is professional, using industry-standard terminology (feeds/speeds, depth of cut, QC department, inspection fixture, gauge block holder). The narrative structure establishes clear context, purpose, and workflow sequence: design verification before manufacturing. Information architecture is logical, separating geometric requirements from machining parameters while maintaining connection through the dovetail specification. The question is immediately actionable, containing all necessary inputs for both tool invocations without ambiguity. The density of information is appropriate for an engineering workflow, reflecting real-world technical communication standards.", "score": 5}, "scenario_realism": {"reasoning": "This scenario authentically mirrors industrial engineering workflows. The context—machining an inspection fixture for a QC department—represents a common manufacturing requirement. The verification-before-production approach (model first to ensure proper mating with gauge block holder) reflects standard shop floor best practices for precision components. Technical details are industry-accurate: 1018 steel is a widely used low-carbon steel for fixtures, ±0.02mm tolerance is appropriate for inspection-grade components, and dovetail joints are standard for precision alignment. The specification of a 20mm carbide dovetail cutter on a vertical CNC mill matches typical machining setups. The shop standard of optimizing for surface finish demonstrates realistic manufacturing constraint awareness. The two-phase request (CAD verification + machining parameters) aligns with how engineers actually work, making this indistinguishable from a genuine technical support query in a manufacturing environment.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The answer contains verifiable objective components with minor subjective elements. The 3D modeling output can be validated by inspecting generated geometry for exact dimensional compliance (30mm width, 10mm depth, 55° angle) and component relationships. The machining parameters (feed rate, spindle speed, depth of cut) are calculable numerical values derived from machinist's handbook formulas and manufacturer data, making them objectively verifiable against standards like those from Harvey Tool, Kennametal, or Sandvik. The \"surface finish optimization\" criterion introduces some subjectivity in parameter selection (e.g., choosing between slightly higher feed with lower speed vs. lower feed with higher speed), but the resulting parameter ranges remain bounded by established engineering principles. The answer format would likely present discrete numerical values and geometric confirmation, enabling automated or manual verification through comparison with manufacturing databases and CAD inspection tools, though slight variations between different tooling manufacturers' recommendations prevent absolute deterministic verification.", "score": 4}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The answer exhibits moderate stability across environmental variations. The geometric model is highly stable—dimensional parameters (30mm, 10mm, 55°) and material designation (1018 steel) are permanent physical constants unaffected by time or location. However, machining parameters demonstrate moderate instability: recommended feeds/speeds evolve with tooling technology updates, manufacturer data revisions, and new cutting tool coatings; different MCP servers may source data from varying references (e.g., MachiningCloud vs. Iscar vs. proprietary shop data); and registry availability of specific machining calculator MCPs could change. Geographic factors have minimal impact as metric standards and 1018 steel (AISI/SAE) are globally recognized, though equivalent steel grades (e.g., C18 in Europe) might cause slight parameter adjustments. System-level variations in Toolbox server discovery could yield different MCP candidates, potentially altering parameter recommendations. The answer is not tied to real-time data or location-specific services, but dependency on third-party machining databases and registry availability introduces moderate temporal and systemic variability.", "score": 3}, "overall_score": 4.0}, "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000004", "row_id": 4, "mode": "onet_occupation", "question_gen_args": {"num_tools": 2, "total_prompts": 10, "output_folder": "../data", "job_name": null, "timestamp": 1769389186, "seed": null}, "onet_soc_code": "51-4035.00", "occupation_title": "Milling and Planing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic", "sampled_tools": [{"server_idx": 708, "tool_idx": 7, "tool_name": "create_dovetail", "server_name": "Sketchup Integration"}, {"server_idx": 572, "tool_idx": 1, "tool_name": "use_tool", "server_name": "Toolbox"}], "mcp_servers": [{"server_id": 906, "server_name": "Sketchup Integration", "rank_by_usage": 907, "server_info": {"id": 906, "name": "Sketchup Integration", "author": "@mhyrr/sketchup-mcp", "overview": "Connect Claude AI to Sketchup for prompt-assisted 3D modeling and scene manipulation.

Second, among the Prompt Server tools, multiple alternatives could address parts of the task: `gen_podcast_script` could generate announcements, `mimeng_headline_master` could create promotional headlines, and `prompt_template_generator` could build reusable templates. Third, the connection to Adwords MCP's `gc` tool is non-obvious—the tool's name doesn't clearly indicate its function, and its relevance to amusement park promotions requires inferential leaps about promotional content generation.

The `gc` tool from Adwords MCP appears particularly non-unique—its function is undefined in the description, and multiple other tools (`gen_podcast_script`, `mimeng_headline_master`) could generate promotional content. The sequential dependency (building a server then using gc) feels artificially constructed rather than naturally necessary.

The business logic is sound: cross-promoting attractions to maximize per-guest spending is standard park operations. The technical approach (using AI to generate engaging promotional copy) reflects modern marketing practices.

The sequence is mandatory: data must be extracted from SketchUp before it can drive Revit documentation. No alternative tool combination can accomplish this workflow. The specific codes generated would be tailored to the exact project requirements (14 banquettes, 40-foot wall, herringbone flooring), making the implementation highly specific to this scenario. This represents a true \"only these tools in this order\" scenario.", "score": 5}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates strong professional context with specific details: project type (2800 sq ft restaurant), timeline pressure (\"tomorrow morning,\" \"Friday\"), precise quantities (14 banquettes, 40-foot wall), and explicit deliverables (material takeoff, cost estimates, shop drawings, elevations, sections). It clearly articulates the workflow bottleneck: \"flow directly from my concept model to construction documentation without manually re-entering all the data.\" The language is professional and action-oriented, reflecting real architectural practice. Minor ambiguities exist around cost data sources and exact drawing standards, but these reflect typical real-world scenario variations rather than flaws. The question effectively communicates constraints, scope, and desired automation level, making it an excellent test of AI-driven AEC workflow capabilities.", "score": 4}, "scenario_realism": {"reasoning": "This scenario mirrors a textbook architectural workflow challenge. SketchUp is indeed the industry standard for rapid conceptual design, and the need to quickly transition to construction documentation in Revit is a daily pain point. The project scope (custom banquettes, acoustic panel feature walls, herringbone flooring) is authentic for upscale restaurant design. Timeline pressures—client expecting immediate cost data, contractor needing shop drawings within days—are standard in commercial practice. The 2800 sq ft size is realistic, and the custom millwork details reflect actual project complexity. While fully automated extraction is somewhat idealized, it represents a genuine industry goal. Stakeholder behaviors (client approval triggering documentation sprint) are completely authentic. This could be a direct quote from a project manager at any design firm.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The answer would primarily consist of custom code (Ruby and C#) whose execution success can be verified objectively. Material quantities extracted from SketchUp can be validated against known model data, and the mathematical calculations can be checked for accuracy. In Revit, one can verify whether scheduled views, elevations, and sections were actually created. However, significant subjective elements remain: \"cost estimates\" depend on external pricing databases not provided, \"detailed shop drawings\" involve professional judgment about adequacy for fabrication, and the quality of panel layout annotation requires domain expertise to evaluate. The answer is not a single deterministic solution—multiple valid implementations could exist. Verification requires both technical execution checks and aesthetic/professional quality assessment, making full validation challenging without controlled test data and expert review.", "score": 2}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The solution's stability is compromised by several factors. Software version dependencies are significant: SketchUp's Ruby API changes between versions, and Revit's C# API varies by release year. The implementation must adapt to model organization conventions—if the SketchUp model uses poor layer naming or inconsistent component structuring, the extraction code will fail. Cost databases are temporally volatile, with material prices fluctuating regularly. Building code requirements vary geographically, affecting detail standards. The Revit template setup (title blocks, view standards, family libraries) is firm-specific, requiring code adaptation. While the general automation approach remains valid, any specific implementation would require customization for project standards, model hygiene, software versions, and local regulations. The answer would be tailored to an implied project context and wouldn't directly transfer without modification.", "score": 2}, "overall_score": 3.8333333333333335}, "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000006", "row_id": 6, "mode": "onet_occupation", "question_gen_args": {"num_tools": 2, "total_prompts": 10, "output_folder": "../data", "job_name": null, "timestamp": 1769389186, "seed": null}, "onet_soc_code": "27-1025.00", "occupation_title": "Interior Designers", "sampled_tools": [{"server_idx": 714, "tool_idx": 13, "tool_name": "send_code_to_revit", "server_name": "Revit Interaction Server"}, {"server_idx": 708, "tool_idx": 9, "tool_name": "eval_ruby", "server_name": "Sketchup Integration"}], "mcp_servers": [{"server_id": 942, "server_name": "Revit Interaction Server", "rank_by_usage": 943, "server_info": {"id": 942, "name": "Revit Interaction Server", "author": "@ideook/revit-mcp", "overview": "Enable AI to interact with Revit projects by retrieving data and driving Revit to create, modify, or delete elements.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm an atmospheric sciences professor who just received a media inquiry from a national journalist with a tight deadline.

The connection to scientificmethod is explicit in the question's wording. While the exact Sci-Hub sub-tool requires minor consideration (search_scihub_by_keyword would be needed first to identify papers, followed by get_paper_metadata for compilation), the question's mention of \"bibliography\" makes get_paper_metadata a logical primary choice. The domain knowledge required is minimal—only basic understanding that Sci-Hub handles academic papers and scientificmethod applies formal reasoning. Alternative approaches exist (e.g., using sequentialthinking instead of scientificmethod), but they would be less appropriate. The tool selection is straightforward with clear indicators, requiring only basic reasoning to connect the question's explicit requirements to the appropriately named tools.", "score": 2}, "tool_selection_uniqueness": {"reasoning": "The scientificmethod tool is highly specialized for \"proper scientific reasoning\" and explicitly supports hypothesis testing, evidence evaluation, and distinguishing confidence levels—exactly what the question requires. Alternative tools like mentalmodel or structuredargumentation could approximate some functions but lack scientificmethod's formal structure for claim differentiation. For the bibliography component, get_paper_metadata is the only tool specifically designed for retrieving paper metadata essential for citation. While search_scihub_by_keyword would be needed first to identify relevant papers, get_paper_metadata remains the appropriate tool for the \"compilation\" step. The sequence is logical: retrieve paper metadata, then apply scientificmethod to structure the answer based on that literature. Alternative combinations would be less efficient or effective—using full PDF downloads would be overkill for a bibliography, and cobbling together multiple reasoning tools would lack scientificmethod's integrated approach. The selected tools are particularly well-matched to the task's dual requirements of literature review and scientific reasoning.", "score": 4}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates exceptional clarity and professional construction. It establishes a realistic role (atmospheric sciences professor), urgent context (national journalist, tight deadline), and quotes the specific inquiry verbatim. The requirements are precise: compile a bibliography from a defined timeframe (2019-2024) on a specific topic (hurricane intensity and climate attribution), structure the answer using proper scientific reasoning, and carefully distinguish between claims with different confidence levels. The dual constraint of being \"scientifically rigorous and accessible\" reflects real-world communication challenges.

The question is highly actionable, leaving no ambiguity about expected outputs while allowing appropriate flexibility in paper selection and answer structuring. Linguistic quality is professional throughout, making this an exemplary user query.", "score": 5}, "scenario_realism": {"reasoning": "This scenario is completely authentic and mirrors real academic-media interactions. Atmospheric scientists frequently receive time-sensitive press inquiries about climate extremes. The journalist's question about \"definitive proof\" accurately reflects common media framing that scientists must carefully contextualize. The need to balance scientific nuance with accessible communication is a genuine professional challenge. All domain details are accurate: Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes are real, climate attribution science is an active research field, and the 2019-2024 timeframe represents current literature. The workflow—receiving inquiry, rapidly reviewing recent research, and crafting a carefully structured response—matches actual professor workflows. Stakeholder behaviors (journalist's tight deadline, scientist's need for rigor) are realistic. No elements feel contrived; this could be a verbatim request from a real scientist preparing for media engagement.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The answer contains strong verifiable components alongside some subjective elements. The bibliography can be objectively validated: each paper's existence, publication date (2019-2024), and topical relevance to hurricane intensity and climate attribution can be confirmed against academic databases like Web of Science or Google Scholar. The structured answer's use of scientific reasoning can be verified by checking for key elements: hypothesis framing, evidence presentation, and uncertainty quantification. The confidence distinctions can be validated against established scientific consensus sources like IPCC AR6 reports. While the accessibility of language and specific phrasing involve subjective judgment, the core factual claims and paper selections are grounded in verifiable sources. The answer format provides clear success criteria: presence of correctly dated papers, appropriate scientific reasoning structure, and accurate representation of scientific confidence levels. This allows for systematic verification rather than relying solely on human judgment.", "score": 4}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The answer demonstrates strong stability across most dimensions but has notable dependencies. The explicit 2019-2024 timeframe creates a fixed temporal boundary, making the paper set stable regardless of when the question is asked. Scientific consensus on hurricane-climate attribution evolves slowly, so core content remains consistent. Geographical and OS variations have minimal impact since MCP servers are platform-independent. However, stability is somewhat compromised by Sci-Hub's variable accessibility—network restrictions in certain regions could prevent tool execution. Additionally, while the 2019-2024 paper set is fixed, judgments about \"most relevant\" could vary slightly between researchers, introducing minor variability.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm restoring a historic building and need to recreate missing ornamental plaster crown molding.

Can you help me first create the custom 3D geometry for this molding component in SketchUp, then apply a realistic historic lime plaster material to it so I can show the client and calculate exact material needs?"}], "quality_assessment_kimi-k2-thinking": {"tool_selection_difficulty": {"reasoning": "The question requires analyzing multiple factors to determine the appropriate tools. First, the user needs to create \"custom 3D geometry\" for an \"acanthus leaf pattern\" - this is complex ornamental geometry that cannot be created with basic component tools. The pattern must repeat every 12 inches along a 20-foot span, requiring parametric, programmatic generation. Among the available tools, only `eval_ruby` has the capability to execute arbitrary code for generating such complex, repeating geometry. This requires the user to: (1) recognize the complexity of acanthus leaf modeling, (2) understand SketchUp's limitations with standard tools, (3) connect the need for parametric modeling to Ruby scripting, and (4) additionally identify `set_material` for the lime plaster application. While an experienced SketchUp user would find this logical, it's not explicitly stated and requires domain knowledge about when scripting is necessary versus manual modeling. The ambiguity level is moderate-to-high, and alternative solutions like using `create_component` would be insufficient for the custom geometry requirement. Therefore, tool selection demands careful reasoning but not extensive expertise beyond standard SketchUp workflow knowledge.", "score": 4}, "tool_selection_uniqueness": {"reasoning": "The intended combination of `eval_ruby` and `set_material` is highly specialized for this task. For the geometry creation, `eval_ruby` is essentially the only viable tool - the alternative would be manually creating each acanthus leaf (which defeats the purpose of AI assistance and the \"custom 3D geometry\" request). The joint-creation tools (`create_mortise_tenon`, `create_dovetail`, `create_finger_joint`) are completely irrelevant to crown molding. Basic tools like `create_component` cannot generate complex parametric geometry. The sequence is also uniquely necessary: geometry must be created before material can be applied, making the `eval_ruby` → `set_material` workflow non-negotiable. The task specifically requires both procedural generation and material assignment in that order, with no viable alternative tool combinations available in the provided set.", "score": 5}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates exceptional quality across all metrics. It provides precise specifications (6-inch height, 12-inch repeat, 20-foot length) and contextual details (historic building restoration, lime plaster material, client presentation, and material quantity calculation). The language is professional and actionable, clearly articulating a two-phase workflow: geometry creation followed by material application. The scenario is well-motivated and includes realistic stakeholder needs. The only minor improvement could be specifying the exact acanthus leaf profile, but this is appropriately left as a design interpretation for the AI. The question effectively balances technical specificity with workflow clarity, making it an excellent example of a professional tool-use query.", "score": 5}, "scenario_realism": {"reasoning": "This scenario is exceptionally authentic and reflects genuine professional practice in heritage conservation. Historic building restoration frequently requires recreating missing ornamental elements. SketchUp is a standard tool for architectural visualization and historical preservation documentation. The specifications are realistic: 6-inch crown molding height is standard, 12-inch pattern repeat is typical for classical ornamentation, and 20-foot wall sections are common in historic structures. Using lime plaster is historically accurate for period-appropriate restoration. The workflow of creating geometry for client review and material quantity takeoffs mirrors actual architectural practice. Every element - from the stakeholder involvement to the material specification - demonstrates industry-accurate knowledge.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The answer can be verified through multiple objective criteria despite containing some subjective design elements. The Ruby code can be validated for: correct component dimensions (6\" height × 20' length), proper pattern repetition logic (12-inch spacing, ~20 instances), and successful component creation in the model space. The material application can be verified by checking that the `set_material` tool was called and that the component has the lime plaster material assigned. While the artistic interpretation of \"acanthus leaf pattern\" involves subjective aesthetics, the functional parameters are entirely measurable. A verification script could confirm dimensional accuracy, pattern repetition count, material assignment, and component naming, providing clear success metrics beyond visual judgment.", "score": 4}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The answer demonstrates complete independence from temporal, geographical, and system variables. The task involves classical architectural elements (acanthus leaf motif) that are timeless and not subject to trends. The dimensional specifications (inches/feet) are unit-system agnostic within SketchUp's environment. SketchUp's Ruby API maintains strong backward compatibility across versions, ensuring code stability. There are no real-time data requirements, location-specific material definitions, or network dependencies. The solution is platform-independent (Windows/Mac), and lime plaster as a historical material has consistent properties.

Could you help me analyze the schematic connections to map out the signal path, and then create a visual flow diagram that shows the entire signal chain? I need the diagram for both troubleshooting and to update our service manual documentation for future repairs."}], "quality_assessment_kimi-k2-thinking": {"tool_selection_difficulty": {"reasoning": "The question requires two distinct capabilities: (1) analyzing schematic connections to trace signal paths through complex components (FPGA, DSP, ADC/DAC), and (2) generating a visual flow diagram. \n\n      For visualization, the choice is deterministic—visualReasoning is the sole available tool for creating diagrams. However, selecting the appropriate KiCad tool demands careful analysis. The user must distinguish between five schematic-related tools: `analyze_schematic_connections`, `extract_project_netlist`, `find_component_connections`, `identify_circuit_patterns`, and `analyze_project_circuit_patterns`. While the question explicitly mentions \"analyze the schematic connections,\" which matches the tool name, the user must still verify the tool description to confirm it handles \"signal paths\" versus mere netlist extraction. The subtle functional differences require domain knowledge: netlist extraction provides raw connectivity data but not necessarily path analysis, pattern identification identifies standard blocks but not arbitrary signal chains, and component-specific tools are too narrow. The need to trace a complete signal chain across multiple stages makes `analyze_schematic_connections` the optimal choice, but this requires reading comprehension and technical reasoning to eliminate plausible alternatives. This is not trivial but achievable with careful tool description review, placing it at the harder end of medium difficulty.", "score": 4}, "tool_selection_uniqueness": {"reasoning": "The tool combination is highly distinctive. For visualization, `visualReasoning` is the exclusive option—no alternative tools exist for diagram generation. For schematic analysis, `analyze_schematic_connections` is uniquely suited: it's the only tool explicitly designed for \"detailed analysis of component connections, including power nets, signal paths, and potential issues.\" While one could theoretically use `extract_project_netlist` and manually trace paths, this would require significantly more post-processing and domain expertise. The two tools have an inherent sequential dependency: schematic data must be extracted and analyzed before it can be visualized. No other tool combination can produce the required visual signal flow diagram. The pairing is perfectly matched to the dual output requirement (analysis + documentation), making alternative approaches substantially less efficient or effective.", "score": 5}, "question_quality": {"reasoning": "The question demonstrates exceptional quality across all dimensions. It provides rich contextual background (live sound installation repair, intermittent signal loss), specifies technical scope (FPGA, DSP, ADC/DAC stages) and origin points (XLR inputs), and articulates a clear dual-purpose objective (troubleshooting + service manual documentation). The language is professional and technically precise, using industry-standard terminology. Actionability is high: requirements are unambiguous, expected deliverables are specified (visual flow diagram of complete signal chain), and the complexity level matches the tool capabilities. No critical information ismissing, and the narrative flows logically from problem description to technical requirements to business justification. This reflects a genuine professional workflow.", "score": 5}, "scenario_realism": {"reasoning": "This scenario is indistinguishable from real-world electronics repair and documentation workflows. Digital audio mixers with FPGA/DSP architectures are standard in professional live sound applications. Intermittent signal loss is a common failure mode requiring systematic signal path tracing. Using KiCad schematics for reverse-engineering and troubleshooting is standard practice in electronics repair shops and OEM service departments. The dual motivation—immediate troubleshooting plus updating service documentation—mirrors professional technician priorities and asset management practices. The component types (XLR inputs, multiple ADC/DAC stages) and signal chain complexity accurately represent high-end audio equipment design. No aspect feels contrived; this is precisely how field service engineers and repair technicians operate.", "score": 5}, "verifiable": {"reasoning": "The answer comprises two verifiable components: (1) a structured connection analysis from the KiCad schematic, and (2) a visual flow diagram. The connection analysis can be objectively validated by cross-referencing the actual schematic files—net names, component references, and pin connections are factual data. The signal path tracing can be verified by systematically checking each identified stage against the source schematic. The visual diagram's content (nodes representing components, edges representing signal flow) is grounded in objective schematic data, though minor layout variations are acceptable. This is more verifiable than free-form text but less deterministic than a single-value answer. Verification requires technical review against source files, but clear success criteria exist: correct component sequence, accurate net identification, and complete path coverage.", "score": 4}, "stability": {"reasoning": "The answer exhibits maximum stability. KiCad project files are static, local assets—no temporal dependencies, network conditions, or real-time data affect the schematic content. Geolocation and operating system differences do not alter circuit connectivity. The only potential variation source is the `visualReasoning` tool's diagram layout algorithms, which may produce visually different but semantically identical graphs. However, the core signal path mapping (component sequence, net names, connection points) is entirely deterministic based on the schematic files.

I've pulled up the KiCad schematic files, but the signal routing through the FPGA, DSP chips, and multiple ADC/DAC stages is pretty complex. I need to trace the complete signal path from the XLR inputs through the processing chain to identify where the signal might be dropping out. Could you help me analyze the schematic connections to map out the signal path, and then create a visual flow diagram that shows the entire signal chain? I need the diagram for both troubleshooting and to update our service manual documentation for future repairs.", "target_tools": "KiCad MCP Server::analyze_schematic_connections, Visual Reasoning Server::visualReasoning", "tool_analysis": "The `analyze_schematic_connections` tool from the KiCad MCP Server provides detailed technical analysis of electronic circuit connections, including signal nets, power distribution, and component interconnections from KiCad schematic files. This raw technical data is essential for understanding circuit topology but can be overwhelming in its native form. The `visualReasoning` tool from the Visual Reasoning Server complements this perfectly by transforming the abstract connection analysis into intuitive visual diagrams. For AV equipment repairers who must both diagnose faults and document systems, this pairing bridges the gap between technical schematic analysis and practical, human-readable service documentation—enabling them to first extract precise connection data, then render it as a clear signal flow diagram for troubleshooting and training purposes.", "cross_tool_workflow": "The workflow begins by using `analyze_schematic_connections` to parse the KiCad schematic file and extract the complete signal path data, including all nets, components, and interconnections between input stages, processing circuits, and output stages. This analysis identifies critical nodes, potential failure points, and the exact routing through complex ICs. The output from this analysis—the structured connection data and netlist information—is then fed to `visualReasoning`, which creates a comprehensive visual flowchart diagramming the signal chain. The visual reasoning tool organizes the components into a logical left-to-right flow, annotates critical test points, and highlights potential failure locations, producing a diagram suitable for field troubleshooting and service manual inclusion."}
