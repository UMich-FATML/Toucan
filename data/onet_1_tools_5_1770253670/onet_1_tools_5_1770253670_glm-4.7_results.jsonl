Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Problems that require a multi-step solution\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n\nYou should:\n1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n9.

Consider workplace tasks that Chief Executives performs such as (but not limited to):\n  - Confer with board members, organization officials, or staff members to discuss issues, coordinate activities, or resolve problems.\n- The scenario should be detailed and authentic, representing genuine use cases that consists of multiple tasks\n\n### Strict Tool Call Generation\n- **Do not hallucinate arguments.** Only use parameters explicitly listed in the \"Strict Argument Schema\" above.\n- **Respect Required Fields.** If a field is listed in `required_fields`, you MUST include it.\n- **Format tool arguments correctly** The `arguments` value of a target_tools entry must be a valid JSON.\n\n### Question Realism\n- Create questions that represent real-world scenarios where users genuinely need multiple tools\n- The question should sound natural and authentic, as if asked by someone with a specific goal\n- Include relevant context, constraints, and details that make the question engaging\n- Consider workflows that require multiple complementary tools working together to accomplish an overall goal\n- Think about how different tools support each other in real-world use cases\n\n### Task Selection\n- The question should require a sequence or combination of tool calls to solve completely\n- Choose tools based on how they complement each other to accomplish an overall goal\n- Consider each tool and its parent MCP server's descriptions when crafting the cross-tool workflow\n- Ensure the tools create a logical, interconnected workflow\n\n### Question Complexity\n- Create questions that are complex enough to warrant using all 1 tools\n- The question should have multiple components or require several steps that perform different tasks to accomplish an overall goal\n- Include relevant context or constraints that make the multi-server tool usage necessary\n- Do not contain the exact tool names or server names in the question\n- Create scenarios that consist of several complementary tasks to accomplish an overall goal\n\n### Cross-Tool Integration\n- Think about how different tools' capabilities can be combined\n- Consider data flow between different tasks (eg, pass the output from one task as input to another task)\n- Create realistic scenarios that consist of multiple complementary tasks to accomplish an overall goal\n- Focus on complementary functionalities across different tools\n\n### Output Format\nYour response should include:\n1. **Tool Analysis**: Briefly analyze the tools and their associated tasks, focusing on how they work together to accomplish an overall goal.\n2. **Cross-Tool Workflow**: Describe the workflow showing how tools will be used together to accomplish an overall goal.\n3. **Target Tasks**: The specific tasks and their task IDs that must be completed to solve the question.\n4. **Target Tools**: The specific tools, their server names, and their input arguments that must be used to solve the question, in the order they would likely be called. The input arguments MUST BE A VALID JSON.\n5. **Question**: A clear, realistic user question that requires tool usage.\n\n## Output\nEnsure your question requires all 1 tools to solve completely. Provide your response in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_analysis\": \"Briefly analyze the tools and their associated tasks, focusing on how they work together to accomplish an overall goal.\",\n  \"cross_tool_workflow\": \"Describe the workflow showing how tools will be used together to solve the question.\",\n  \"target_tasks\": [\n    {\"id\": \"8823\", \"description\": \"Direct or coordinate an organization's financial or budget activities to fund operations, maximize investments, or increase efficiency.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"8824\", \"description\": \"Confer with board members, organization officials, or staff members to discuss issues, coordinate activities, or resolve problems.\"}\n  ],\n  \"target_tools\": [\n    {\"server\": \"Server1\", \"tool\": \"get_weather\", \"arguments\": {\"location\": \"Paris, France \"}},\n    {\"server\": \"Server2\", \"tool\": \"send_email\", \"arguments\": {\"to\": \"bob@email.com\",\"body\": \"Hi bob\"}}\n  ],\n  \"question\": \"A clear, realistic user question that requires multi-server tool usage spanning different services/domains.\"\n}\n``` \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```json\n{\n  \"tool_analysis\": \"The collaborativereasoning tool from Clear Thought Server enables structured multi-perspective analysis for complex strategic decisions.
